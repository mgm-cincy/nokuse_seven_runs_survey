# nokuse_seven_runs_survey
A spatially balanced probabilistic stream survey of Seven Runs, a tributary of the Choctawhatchee River.

The purpose of this survey is to answer the question: Is the median turbidity of McKinnon tributary greater than the median turbidity of other tributaries in Sevens Run, and is the turbidity of the of the mainstem below the McKinnon Branch confluence greater than the mainstem turbidity above that confluence?

This survey design will use two surveys, with the first survey collected at base flow conditions, and the other survey at higher discharge conditions after a local rainfall event. Having 2 surveys done will allow a change analysis to used on the survey data. The hypotheses are 1) at base flow there will not be differences among the stratum of tributaries, McKinnon Branch vs other tributaries, nor among mainstem sample sites above or below the McKinnon Branch confluence. However, after rainfall event when there is runoff and overland flow and discharge is higher, then we expect differences between tributary and mainstem strata.
